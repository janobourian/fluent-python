# fluent-python
A complete guide to learn, implement and development well python code. 

## Information

* The Python Data Model is the API that we use to make our own objects play well with the most idiomatic language features. The data model is a description of Python as a framework. It formalizes the interfaces of the building blocks of the language itself. 

## Data Model

* The Python Data Model: It describes the API that you can use to make your own objects play well with the most idiomatic language
* The dunder methods are so important and you have not touch them
* Collections module provides specialized container datatypes that offer enhanced functionality or performance for specific cases
* Container are data structures that can hold multiple objects or values
    * List
    * Dicts
    * Sets
    * Strings
    * Tuples
* Remember this three levels:
    * First:
        * Iterable `__iter__`
        * Sized `__len__`
        * and Container `__contains__` (to have `in` operation)
    * Second:
        * Reversible 
        * and Collections
    * Third:
        * Sequence, 
        * Mapping, 
        * and Set

## Sequences

## Dictionaries and Sets

## Important modules

* collections: it has some common options to manage built-in containers like list, sets, dicts, and tuples
* random: some operations to create random options
